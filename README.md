# AI-Project
Project submissions for Red Dragon AI courses. 
I learnt the concepts on Artificial Intelligence and their applications on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing as well as how to prepare the data for training and testing using Python.

In my projects, I implemented an object detection model using Mask R-CNN and a text generation model using the GPT-2 model.
